## General Basics
### 0.Git and GitHub
It was interesting to finish this course, but was difficult at some points of it. Maybe because I have never worked with command line before.

### 1.Linux CLI, and HTTP
  This course introduced me with command line. I have never used command line before and I wish I have done this course before I started "How To Use Git and Github" course.
  I knew many new things from those two articles. It was so new, that I had to ask my friend to explain matherial described there)

### 2.Git Collaboration
This part was much more easier and constructive then previous course about Git and Github. From one side because I have studied command line already and from another  side these courses are more userfriendly by their own for my opinion.

### 3.Intro to HTML and CSS
